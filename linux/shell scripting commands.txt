if else condition in linux 
---------------------------------
#!bin/bash
echo "please enter the number-1"
read number1

read number2
if [ $number1 -gt  $number2 ]
then

for loop 
------------------------
for (( num=1;num<=5;num++ ))
do
echo $num
done

while loop to print num from 1 to 5
---------------------------------------
i=1
while [ $i -le 5 ]
do
echo $i
i=`expr $i + 1`
done


switch case - below $1 is the orgument it will execute llike [ sh test.sh 1]
-----------------------
case $1 in

start)

====================
create the functions in one .sh file and calling the same functions from another .sh file need to add
source ./functions_file_name  --> in top of another file
